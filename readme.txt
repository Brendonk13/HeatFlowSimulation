Note that I changed "private String[] soupFiles ={..}" in meshProcessingApp.
Since one of the elements was: "meshdata/icosphere2.obj"
which did not correspond with the actual filename: icoSphere2.obj
(I capitalized the S in meshProcessingApp)
I also had to change the header in my shader file to: #version 130.
